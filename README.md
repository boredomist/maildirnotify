maildirnotify
=============

It displays an icon when you have a new message in your
maildir. That's about it.

You need Vala and GTK+ and all that lovely nonsense.

`./maildirnotify --help`

Why
---

Because I kept not noticing the notify-send hooks I had. There are a
billion and one different options available to you, and this is
incredibly simple. You probably won't have a use for it.
